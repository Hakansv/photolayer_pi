# photolayer_pi
Plugin for OpenCPN using GeoTiff satellite photo overlay files.

The transparency can be adjusted, allowing easy comparison of features. OpenGL gives the best results.

GeoTiff files can be downloaded from 'VentureFarther.com' or converted from kaps using the MAP2CMAPCNET program from John Thorn (Mercator lat/lon).
